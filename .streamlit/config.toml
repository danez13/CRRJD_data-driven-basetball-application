[browser]
# Port where users should point their browsers in order to connect to the
# app.
# This is used to:
# - Set the correct URL for XSRF protection purposes.
# - Show the URL on the terminal (part of `streamlit run`).
# - Open the browser automatically (part of `streamlit run`).
# This option is for advanced use cases. To change the port of your app, use
# `server.Port` instead. Don't use port 3000 which is reserved for internal
# development.
# Default: whatever value is set in server.port.
