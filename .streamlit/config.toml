# Controls whether uncaught app exceptions and deprecation warnings
# are displayed in the browser. By default, this is set to True and
# Streamlit displays app exceptions and associated tracebacks, and
# deprecation warnings, in the browser.
#
# If set to False, deprecation warnings and full exception messages
# will print to the console only. Exceptions will still display in the
# browser with a generic error message. For now, the exception type and
# traceback show in the browser also, but they will be removed in the
# future.
# Default: true

# Change the visibility of items in the toolbar, options menu,
# and settings dialog (top right of the app).
# Allowed values:
# * "auto"      : Show the developer options if the app is accessed through
#                 localhost or through Streamlit Community Cloud as a developer.
#                 Hide them otherwise.
# * "developer" : Show the developer options.
# * "viewer"    : Hide the developer options.
# * "minimal"   : Show only options set externally (e.g. through
#                 Streamlit Community Cloud) or through st.set_page_config.
#                 If there are no options left, hide the menu.
# Default: "auto"

# Controls whether the default sidebar page navigation in a multipage app is

# Default: true

[server]
# The port where the server will listen for browser connections.
# Don't use port 3000 which is reserved for internal development.
# Default: 8501

# Max size, in megabytes, for files uploaded with the file_uploader.
# Default: 200

# Max size, in megabytes, of messages that can be sent via the WebSocket
# connection.
# Default: 200

[browser]
# Port where users should point their browsers in order to connect to the
# app.
# This is used to:
# - Set the correct URL for XSRF protection purposes.
# - Show the URL on the terminal (part of `streamlit run`).
# - Open the browser automatically (part of `streamlit run`).
# This option is for advanced use cases. To change the port of your app, use
# `server.Port` instead. Don't use port 3000 which is reserved for internal
# development.
# Default: whatever value is set in server.port.
